# Exercise to explore pathfinding algorithms in java programming language

### My plan: 
1. Get to draw a maze
2. Get a working algorithm to solve the maze
3. At first it will be simple but my go to is the A* or Djikstra's algorithm
4. When I have my A* or Djikstra working, I would like to make it edcative so that it is possible to see the weights and calculations of eacht step and that sort of things.
5. Maybe go back and try to work out an algorithm to generate mazes on its own.

All of these things in a Java GUI environment that is very visual.
